      <description>Python and R!  Before this course, I have never used Python before. After getting to learn about it for the past few weeks, I found that there are many similarities between Python and R! One useful tool in Python, is Pandas, a package with many data manipulation tools like the ones used in R. I had previously done data minipulation in R (project 1), and was excited to use the Pandas package in Python to do the same.</description>

Two datasets were chosen for my exploratory data analysis project. The first dataset covid, was found on kaggle.com, and contains 8 variables total, 1 categorical and 7 numeric. The covid data has 51 observations, one for each of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. For each state, data is given for the number of COVID-19 tests administered, the amount of people infected by COVID, the amount of deaths as a result of COVID, the state population, the average income of the residents, the GDP, and percentage of unemployment.</description>

The dataset chosen for this project is &#39;medicalcost&#39; and shows different variables of individual patients that could influence the medical charges they recieve for their visit. There are 1338 observations for each of the 7 variables in the dataset: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, and charges. Age is a numeric variable which gives the patient&#39;s age. Sex is a categorical variable and tells whether the patient is male or female.</description>
