# Python and R!
![](/img/python.png)

Before this course, I have never used Python before. After getting to learn about it for the past few weeks, I found that there are many similarities between Python and R! One useful tool in Python, is Pandas, a package with many data manipulation tools like the ones used in R. I had previously done data minipulation in R [(project 1)](/project/project1/), and was excited to use the Pandas package in Python to do the same. 

## Using Pandas in Python 
Pandas can be used to emulate the tidyverse functions in R. A few handy functions to use are shown below!

```{R}
quakes <- quakes
head(quakes)
```
.filter() is used to select and .query() is used to filter the dataset:
```{python}
import pandas as pd
(r.quakes
.filter(['mag', 'stations'])
.query('stations > 20')
).head()
```
.melt() is used to pivot the dataset longer:
```{python}
pd.melt(r.quakes).head()
```
.assign() can be used to create a new variable in the dataset:
```{python}
r.quakes.assign(depthcat = pd.cut(r.quakes['depth'], bins=3, labels=['low', 'med', 'high'])).head()
```
Those are just a few of the functions Pandas has to offer, I suggest trying them all out for yourself! 

## Using reticulate so Python and R can communicate 
Another super cool thing I learned this semester is that it is actually possible to communicate between R and Python! Take a look at this... using a handy package called reticulate, R can talk...
```{R}
library(reticulate)
Rtalk <- "'Hello this is R speaking, can you hear me?'"
```
Then, using some python code... python can also talk. Because of reticulate, R said hello to Python, and Python is able to respond. 
```{python}
Ptalk = "'Hey R! This is Python! :)'"
print(r.Rtalk, Ptalk)
```
Like they say about any good, stable, fulfilling relationship... "communication is key"... and this is no different for R and Python.
R studio allows R and Python to form this beautiful, harmonious relationship, even though they speak different languages!
