Two datasets were chosen for my exploratory data analysis project. The first dataset covid, was found on kaggle.com, and contains 8 variables total, 1 categorical and 7 numeric. The covid data has 51 observations, one for each of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. For each state, data is given for the number of COVID-19 tests administered, the amount of people infected by COVID, the amount of deaths as a result of COVID, the state population, the average income of the residents, the GDP, and percentage of unemployment.</description>

The dataset chosen for this project is &#39;medicalcost&#39; and shows different variables of individual patients that could influence the medical charges they recieve for their visit. There are 1338 observations for each of the 7 variables in the dataset: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, and charges. Age is a numeric variable which gives the patient&#39;s age. Sex is a categorical variable and tells whether the patient is male or female.</description>
